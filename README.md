<!-- Approach For Recursive problem  -->

step 1 :Identify the Potential for Recursion: Start by evaluating the problem statement to check if it can be solved using recursion. 
A problem is a good candidate for a recursive solution if it involves multiple stages of decision-making or requires exploration of 
different paths or choices.

step 2 : Visualize with a Recursive Tree: If the problem seems to fit, try to visualize its solution as a recursive tree. Each node in 
the tree represents a state of the problem, and each edge represents a step towards the solution. This step can be very helpful for 
understanding the recursive structure of the problem and the relations between different states.

step 3 : Translate the Recursive Solution into Code:

Base Condition: First, identify the base condition(s) for the recursion. These are the scenarios in which the function can provide a
direct answer without making any further recursive calls. In other words, they are the leaves of the recursive tree.

Recursive Relation: Then, define the recursive relation, which describes how to build the solution to a problem from the solutions 
to its subproblems. This is the core of a recursive function.

Additional Processing (if needed): Finally, there might be some additional processing required before or after the recursive calls T.
his could involve preparing data for the recursive calls, combining the results of the recursive calls, or performing some cleanup operations.
